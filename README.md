# Data Science <hr>

Repo for the Learn Data Science program

Coderplex and Facebook DevC Hyderabad are organizing a series of Data Science meetups from November 2019 onwards. This series will go on for at least 3 months, but can extend longer as well. We will have at least two or more meetups per month throughout the series. We will be sharing and following our open online curriculum for learning Data Science, that anyone can go through. But we will be selecting only a smaller group of people to attend these offline meetups, they will not be listed anywhere. They will be shared privately with this selected group

At each meetup, we will have a talk from an Data Science expert from the ecosystem, and after that we'll have hours of peer learning and collaboration. Participates will pair together and work through challenges and projects, and they will also be encouraged to regularly share their progress with everyone

These will be full day meetups. We will of course have food and also some swag to give away, if any participants are performing well and making a lot of progress

We will have 10-15 mentors throughout the program, who will provide guidance to the participants. And some of them will be giving the talks

And of course, it goes without saying, this will be free to participate. No participate will be charged anything. And we will most likely try to have a hiring drive towards the end as well, if possible, for those who want to work in the space
